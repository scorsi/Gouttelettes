# Gouttelettes Engine

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scorsi/Gouttelettes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scorsi/Gouttelettes)

Gouttelettes is a 3D Game Engine written in full-Kotlin with high-performances designed to create powerful graphics using OpenGL.

This is the third time I restart my game-engine, so the project is under hard (and actually fast) development.

## Preview

One cube with a diffuse and specular texture. One source light.

We can see the source light reflection on the edge of the box.
